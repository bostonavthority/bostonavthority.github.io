The department shall analyze the petition without any undue delay and shall work with petitioners and, if possible, with other stakeholders as defined by the department, to reach a solution that would be acceptable for all parties involved.” Note that the effect of the new provisions will be mostly instructive, providing more of a guidelines on how to evaluate such petitions.
